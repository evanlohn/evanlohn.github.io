<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Evan lohn. I am a PhD student (began Fall 2021) in the Computer Science Department
at Carnegie Mellon University. I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mheule/">Marijn
Heule</a> and <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/">Jeremy Avigad</a> for my first two years, and I will be leaving with a Masters degree Summer 2024.
</p>
<p>
In the past, I worked with Pieter Abbeel at the BAIR lab on applications of deep unsupervised learning to image compression. I'm still very much interested in potential applications of deep unsupervised learning (especially for theorem proving), but 
more recently I've been approaching theorem proving from the perspective of automated reasoning and interactive theorem provers like <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">Lean</a>. I'm broadly interested in automated and interactive theorem proving, and I'm very interested in applications of LLMs to reasoning more broadly.
</p>
